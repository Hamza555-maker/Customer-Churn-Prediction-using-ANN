# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to **churn (leave the bank)** or **stay**, using historical customer data.  
It includes a fully interactive dashboard where users can input customer details and get real-time churn predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is one of the most valuable use cases in business analytics.  
In this project, we build and compare **machine learning models** — including **Random Forest** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** — to identify customers at high risk of leaving.

We then integrate these models into an **interactive dashboard**, allowing end-users to:
- Input new customer data  
- Instantly see the predicted churn probability  
- Visualize the risk level with a clear and friendly interface

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed real-world dataset (`Churn_Modelling.csv`)  
✅ Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features  
✅ Trained multiple models (Random Forest, ANN) for comparison  
✅ Visualized important correlations and churn insights with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
✅ Created an **interactive dashboard** using `ipywidgets` (for Jupyter) and `Streamlit` (for deployment)  
✅ User-friendly interface for live prediction and data visualization
